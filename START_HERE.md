## 🆘 When You Get Stuck

### Technical Issues
1. Check **QUICK_START.md** troubleshooting section
2. Review **docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** for design decisions
3. Consult **docs/PHASE1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE.md** for code examples

### Planning Issues
1. Review **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** for context
2. Check **TODO_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md** for dependencies
3. Adjust timeline if needed (but maintain quality)

### Scope Questions
1. Ask: "Is this required for government use?"
2. Check acceptance criteria in roadmap

## 🎓 Key Principles to Remember

### 1. **This is NOT a startup MVP**
- Don't cut corners on security
- Don't skip compliance steps
- Don't rush audits

### 2. **Optimize for Trust**
- Transparency over speed
- Auditability over convenience
- Resilience over features

### 3. **Antigravity Principles**
- Reduce complexity for users
- Make power visible, not hidden
- Systems should feel lighter than they are
- Trust through transparency

### 4. **Government Context**
- Every decision must be traceable
- No single point of failure
- Privacy is a right, not a feature
- Accessibility is mandatory

## 🎯 Final Reminder

**You are building critical public infrastructure.**

This is not a hackathon project. This is not a demo. This is a platform that could:
- Govern cities
- Manage public funds
- Protect citizen rights
- Enable democratic participation

Build accordingly. 🏛️
